# Analyzing UFO Risk with PostGIS and H3

H3 is a hierarchical global grid system developed by Uber to support large-scale spatial analysis.  
It also provides some useful capabilities for visualization.

H3 can be used with PostGIS by installing the h3-pg extension.
This provides an API of over 80 functions which allow easy conversion between H3 cells and PostGIS geometries.

We'll show how to build a web-based dashboard to present various kinds of UFO data analysis.
H3 will be used to enable efficient spatial analysis and display of data.
