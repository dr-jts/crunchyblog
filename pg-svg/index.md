# Creating Maps and Images with PostGIS and `pg-svg`

One of the most powerful and informative things to do with geospatial data is to visualize it on a map.  There are many ways of doing this.  Data can be rendering to a raster image using a map server like GeoServer or MapServer; the raw data can be shipped to a Web browser and rendered using a library such as OpenLayers or Leaflet; or a client GIS application such as QGIS can connect to the database and create richly-styled maps from the data.
