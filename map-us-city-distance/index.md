# Using PostGIS and pg-svg to create a Distance map

As a declarative language with powerful set-processing capabilities, SQL is an ideal language for generating graphical images
(which often involve many nearly-similar elements).
When combined with the geospatial processing capabilities of [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) and the [Scalable Vector Graphics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) (SVG) output enabled by [`pg-svg`](https://github.com/dr-jts/pg_svg), 
it makes for an easy way to generate interesting map visualizations.

For example, here's how to create a map showing distances from US cities, with some interesting visual effects.

This image is generated by a single SQL query, using CTEs to break it up into simple linear steps.

The first step is to create an outline of the continental USA for use as the map base.  
In this case we have created a polygon offline and included it as data in the query.
You could also source this from a dataset such as Natural Earth, perhaps loaded in a table.
It's best to use a polygon with a reasonably small number of vertices (say about 1000).
If the source data has more vertices, you can reduce it using the `ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology` function.

Next is to obtain locations for the cities displayed on the map.  
Here the data is sourced from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population), and provided as in-query data.  
Of course, points could also be sourced from any desired table.
